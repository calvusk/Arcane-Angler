## Arcane-Angler Version 1.0

This is a fishing "bot" I have created for Arcane Odyssey.

# Features
-effective fishing using a combination of sound and image recognition

-a space to upload template images (generally the "!" icon) to look for, these are what it looks for when fishing.

-a space to upload "quit" images. When these are found, the program is stopped, the game is left, and a screenshot 
is taken so that you can see what caused it to quit. 

-when the quit image is found, you can have a custom message be sent in the chat. This is toggelable and customizable 
in the settings panel. It only works, however, when the microsoft store version of roblox is used, so make sure to set which
version you are using in the settings panel.

-the program will automatically feed the player after some time, before switching back to the rod. 
make sure to keep your rod on slot 1, and your food on slot 2, for this to work correctly. 

-when the microsoft store version of the game is selected in settings, your character will reset before leaving
when the quit image is found, to prevent logging.


# Instructions
After you first run the program, go to the settings panel. You will need to upload at least one quit and template image, the most important
being the ! icon for fishing, and the crossed swords icon for combat. After this, choose which version of roblox you plan to use. 
If you are using the microsoft store version of roblox, you can make a custom chat message to be sent when the quit image is seen, and 
your character will reset before leaving to prevent combat tagging. Once you do all of this, and test each feature, follow these steps:
1: place your rod in slot one, and your food in slot 2.
2: change your roblox settings' (not the anglers settings!) opacity to 100%, or where its fully dark.
3: turn down ambient and music noise in the arcane odyssey settings to 0%.
4: turn up your computers volume. You can unplug or turn off your speaker/headphone and the sound recognition will still work. 
5: click fish. 
# Tips
-Doing this whilst afk is bannable. If you do it while afk, do it in a safe, remote location whilst having neutral rep to prevent people 
from finding you.

-Your food source should be a large store of some stackable, non cooked fruit such as 200 grapes. 

-Always keep your rod on slot one, and the food on slot 2. 

-Try to fish in a place where you have a wall behind you.

-Test all features of the program before you go afk.
